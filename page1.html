I see this server as a journaling space with occasional interactable characters in it, knowing them a bit fills me with doubt on myself, so it's easier if everyone's a stranger and I'm the clown in my mind, and I also figured that if I mess up my room long enough, so I'm gonna talk with no regrets till I learn, because I will eventually have to clean it up

(the text above is not the full story)

I'm attached to this server because this is the first place where I felt satisfied to chat on 8 months ago, when I have never truly had a conversation with anyone for 4 years, everyone is cool and confident in expressing themselves, and right now I am discouraged because I feel like a blight on this place, even before you mentioned my unwelcomeness

I don't wanna keep complaining about being unproductive again like I have been for the past 6 months, I'm scared of hard work and productiveness, I don't wanna do what anyone tells me because everyone feels like a stranger, I've been developing this self-sabotaging personality for so long in my teenage years that idk if I can unlearn it.</textarea>
