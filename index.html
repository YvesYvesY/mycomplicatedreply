I think I'm gonna keep doing it tho, I don't want my repressed emotions to spill out to ppl in my life, and I guess this server is a tool to process that

But I think I just made a circlejerk of sadness with only me in the group, I think you don't care cuz I don't care abt how you feel as I type this but I'm very scared and insecure about speaking what's in my mind, building walls of fantasy around everything I see with me in the castle thinking all alone

I just idealized myself again, but maybe I'll like change for the better if I stop being scared to talk to people, be brave in my mind

(the text above is not genuine)

I see this server as a journaling space with occasional interactable characters in it, knowing them a bit fills me with doubt on myself, so it's easier if everyone's a stranger and I'm the clown in my mind, and I also figured that if I mess up my room long enough, so I'm gonna talk with no regrets till I learn, because I will eventually have to clean it up
