I am spiteful, jealous, and greedy. And if you see this, it means I've done my habit of showing everything I'm doing that I think has even a little bit of value, that's because my daydreams are too grand, too habitual that I try and fulfill that delusion by creating dopamine hits on my creations, which is normal imo, and how I talk? this is the result of countless hours of video essays and trivia bullshit that I only got the smart-ass way of talking out of

You calling me smart feels like the time I keep arguing with my father, he has confidence on me, calling me smart and entertaining my repeated insistent arguments that is filled with burning passion and spite, he keeps saying to pour water his way, to scrub the dishes this way repeatedly, then he did the same when we talk about politics, just repeated insistent bellitlement and saying I will likely join a terrorist group, I believed it, because hear things repeated anough and you believe it, I remember crying in lots of the nights that this happens, and even now I feel like crying when he confronts me with conversation, I'm not emotionally supported and I'm sorry for that</textarea>
