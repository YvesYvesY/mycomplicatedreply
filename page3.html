I'm gonna die early due to feeling stress most of my life anyway, so who cares, like stress really really affects your health and yeah, my 2 year younger brother started showing signs of bipolarness a year ago precisely, he kept badmouthing me for all my hopelessness and reclusiveness and I keep brushing off his insults saying I'll forget it like how I forget my many problems and bad moments by thinking hard to not think, and I have never talked about this to anyone for a year, except here, he's been back now for 8 months and we have never talked at all, I ignored him too long even before his mental break, and I guess that's what is rn

I've exhausted my mental energy, thanks for the think, sorry for the late reply and I hope you don't get read this part because it feels cringe, but I want to do cringe things, and to feel less like an abomination in my head, I complain too much, whine too much on the internet, why not make it absurd?
